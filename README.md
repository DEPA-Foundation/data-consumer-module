Data Consumer Module

The DCM is a vitally important piece of software for the DEPA ecosystem.  The availability of a high quality DCM will allow companies to easily and swiftly adopt the DEPA framework and begin consuming data.

A useful DCM will help financial information users do the following:
- Embed consent collection journeys in their existing apps and websites (by generating a custom consent request and directing it to the appropriate Account Aggregator - AA - endpoint)
- Provide connections with various AA aplications
- Store and manage consent artefacts
- Decrypt and parse incoming financial data (eg. once decrypted, can we build helper libraries to parse the XML into popular language objects)
- Help with storage of user data in accordance with user consent
